## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### 1. WebSocket Broadcast Loop Error (Critical)

**Error:**
```
Error in broadcast loop: dictionary changed size during iteration
```

**Cause:**
The `active_connections` dictionary is being modified (client disconnect) while the broadcast loop is iterating over it.

**Impact:**
- WebSocket updates may fail intermittently
- Connected clients may not receive real-time updates
- Broadcast loop crashes and needs to restart

**Location:** `backend/app/services/websocket_manager.py`

**Fix Required:** Use thread-safe iteration or create a snapshot of connections before iterating.

---

### 2. WebSocket Keepalive Timeout (Moderate)

**Error:**
```
Error sending to c9c2446c-5f45-434f-9903-95152f4b1621: sent 1011 (internal error) keepalive ping timeout; no close frame received
WebSocket disconnected: c9c2446c-5f45-434f-9903-95152f4b1621
```

**Cause:**
- Client not responding to keepalive pings
- Network issues or client tab backgrounded
- Ping timeout threshold may be too aggressive

**Impact:**
- Client connections timeout and disconnect
- Requires reconnection from frontend
- May cause unnecessary reconnection overhead

**Potential Solutions:**
- Increase keepalive timeout interval
- Improve client-side ping response handling
- Add automatic reconnection logic in frontend

---

### 3. Missing Favicon (Minor)

**Error:**
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:52389 - "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found
```

**Cause:** Browser automatically requests `/favicon.ico` but backend doesn't serve it.

**Impact:** None - purely cosmetic

**Fix:** Add favicon endpoint or serve static files from frontend.

---

## Performance Observations

### Request Patterns

**High Frequency Requests:**
- `/api/satellites/40267/azel` - Azimuth/Elevation queries
  - Multiple concurrent requests (~5-6 connections)
  - Same satellite (40267) being polled repeatedly
  - Location: lat=43.47151, lon=27.78379 (Bulgaria region)

**Moderate Frequency:**
- `/api/satellites/{id}/orbit` - Orbit propagation
  - Duration: 4 hours, Step: 1 minute (240 data points)
  - Also duration: 2 hours, Step: 5 minutes (24 data points)

### Database Query Caching

```
2025-10-24 17:22:41,728 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine [cached since 584.8s ago] {}
```
- ✅ SQLAlchemy query cache working effectively
- ✅ ~9.7 minutes between health checks
- ✅ No unnecessary database roundtrips

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority: High)

1. **Fix WebSocket Dictionary Iteration Bug**
   ```python
   # Current (BROKEN):
   for client_id, websocket in self.active_connections.items():
       await websocket.send_json(data)

   # Fixed:
   for client_id in list(self.active_connections.keys()):
       if client_id in self.active_connections:
           await self.active_connections[client_id].send_json(data)
   ```

2. **Add Error Handling to Broadcast Loop**
   - Wrap individual client sends in try/except
   - Continue broadcasting to other clients if one fails
   - Log errors but don't crash the broadcast loop

### Short-term Improvements (Priority: Medium)

3. **Optimize Polling Frequency**
   - Current: Multiple concurrent azimuth/elevation requests
   - Consider: WebSocket-based real-time updates instead of polling
   - Benefit: Reduce server load, faster updates

4. **Implement Request Caching**
   - Cache orbit calculations for same parameters
   - Cache azimuth/elevation for same location/time window
   - Set reasonable TTL (e.g., 10-30 seconds)

5. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - Protect endpoints from excessive polling
   - Implement per-client rate limits
   - Return 429 Too Many Requests when exceeded

### Long-term Optimizations (Priority: Low)

6. **Database Integration for Satellite Data**
   - Currently using in-memory cache
   - Store satellites in PostgreSQL
   - Query from database instead of cache
   - Enable complex queries and filtering

7. **Batch API Endpoints**
   - Create `/api/satellites/batch/azel` endpoint
   - Accept multiple satellite IDs in single request
   - Reduce network overhead

8. **Add Monitoring**
   - Track WebSocket connection metrics
   - Monitor endpoint response times
   - Alert on high error rates
